## Overview

Volis is a C-Level executive dashboard that transforms raw e-commerce data into actionable business intelligence. It is structured around four core stakeholders — **CFO, COO, Head of CS, and Head of Marketplace** — each with a dedicated page tailored to their decision-making needs.

The data pipeline follows a three-layer dbt architecture (`intermediate → marts → summary`), with DuckDB as the local warehouse and Reflex rendering the UI entirely in Python.

| Transformation | dbt-core | Data modeling, lineage, documentation |
| UI Framework | Reflex | Python-native full-stack web app |
| Data Source | Olist (Kaggle) | Brazilian e-commerce dataset (2016–2018) |

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ (required by Reflex)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/volis-case.git
cd volis-case
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install dbt-duckdb reflex duckdb
```

### 4. Build the dbt models

```bash
cd volis_analytics
dbt seed          # loads raw CSVs into DuckDB
dbt run           # builds all intermediate + mart models
cd ..
```

> This generates `volis_analytics/dev.duckdb` with all tables ready.

### 5. Run the Reflex dashboard

```bash
cd business_analytics_dashboard
reflex run
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

### The Goal

The Volis C-Level Dashboard exists to give senior executives a **single source of truth** for the company's operational, financial, and customer health — without needing to run SQL queries or wait for weekly reports.

The dashboard is designed to answer the question: *"Is the business healthy right now, and where should we focus our attention?"*

### Actions & Business Value

Each dashboard page is designed to drive specific executive decisions:

**CFO**
- Identify revenue growth or decline trends and act on pricing or promotions
- Monitor refund rate spikes that indicate product or logistics quality issues
- Understand payment method mix to negotiate better rates with payment providers

**COO**
- Detect bottlenecks in the fulfillment pipeline (approval, posting, last-mile)
- Track delivery rate over time to hold sellers and logistics partners accountable
- Identify periods with high failure rates that require operational intervention

**CS**
- Correlate delivery delays with review score drops to prioritize logistics investments
- Monitor score distribution to detect emerging dissatisfaction trends
- Benchmark the impact of late deliveries on customer satisfaction (on-time vs. late score gap)

**Marketplace**
- Identify top-performing sellers and categories to prioritize partnerships and promotions
- Monitor seller concentration risk (heavy dependence on few sellers)
- Track freight trends to negotiate logistics contracts

### Data Sources

All data originates from the [Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) (2016–2018), loaded as dbt seeds.

#### Raw Tables (Seeds)

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `olist_orders_dataset` | Order lifecycle: status, timestamps |
| `olist_order_items_dataset` | Items per order: price, freight, seller |
| `olist_order_payments_dataset` | Payment method and value per order |
| `olist_order_reviews_dataset` | Customer review scores and dates |
| `olist_products_dataset` | Product metadata including category |
| `olist_sellers_dataset` | Seller location data |
| `olist_customers_dataset` | Customer location data |
| `olist_geolocation_dataset` | ZIP code to lat/lon mapping |
| `product_category_name_translation` | Portuguese → English category names |

#### dbt Model Layers

**Intermediate** — typed, cleaned, joined base models. No business logic.

| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| `int_orders` | Orders with all status and timestamp fields typed |
| `int_order_items` | Items joined with product category |
| `int_payments` | Payments joined with order dates |
| `int_reviews` | Reviews with score and creation date |

**Marts** — aggregated, business-logic models, one row per date or entity.

| Model | Grain | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `mart_financials` | Day | gross_revenue, refunded_revenue, total_orders |
| `mart_payment_distribution` | Day × payment_type | total_payment_value |

### Next Steps

Given another 10 hours, the following improvements would be prioritized:

**Data & Modeling**
- Add dbt tests (`not_null`, `unique`, `accepted_values`) to all intermediate and mart models
- Add dbt `sources.yml` documentation with freshness checks
- Pre-aggregate mart tables by month and year in dbt to eliminate the Python aggregation layer in the dashboard and improve performance
- Add a `mart_geolocation` model to enable regional analysis (revenue and delivery time by state)

**Dashboard**
- Add a Brazil choropleth map showing revenue and delivery performance by state
- Add seller-level drill-down: click a seller in the Top 15 to see their individual performance
- Add period-over-period comparison (e.g., this month vs. last month, with % change badges on KPI cards)
- Implement responsive layout for tablet and mobile viewports
- Add export to CSV functionality for each chart's underlying data

**Infrastructure**
- Deploy to Reflex Cloud or Railway for a shareable public URL
- Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions to run `dbt test` on every push
- Move DuckDB to a persistent volume or migrate to MotherDuck for multi-user access
